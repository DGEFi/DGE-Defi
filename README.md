# DGEFI Protocols

## DGEFI（Distributed Green Energy Finance Protocol）

DGEFI is an innovative decentralized financial agreement and an innovation in programmable currency and community governance. It is built by a set of DeFi intelligent protocols, thus forming a bank-like business. All intelligent protocols of decentralized finance are deployed and implemented by GBank's professional technicians and financial professionals on Ethereum. Aim to create:

~ Flexible Supply to seek steady growth in the ultimate intrinsic value of digital tokens；

~ Manageable fund products to further support the stability of the intrinsic value of fund shares；

~ Complete on-chain governance to achieve decentralized and trust-free financial derivatives；

~ Fair distribution mechanism to encourage key community members to actively master governance；

DGE is the token of DGEFI agreement, one DGE is equal to one fund share, and the total number of initial issuance is 1 million, that is, 1 million DGE. The initial value of one fund share is zero. The core of DGEFI is an elastic supply encryption digital cash mechanism, which will inflate and reduce its supply according to market conditions. Its goal is to increase or decrease the underlying assets, if the intrinsic value of the fund shares represented by DGE increases or decreases by 30%, the supply of DGE will inflate or shrink by 10%.

This robust mechanism includes a supplement to the existing elastic supply model \(such as Ampleforth\). A part of each inflation expansion is used to purchase a set of digital assets with higher returns and lower risks, and add it to the bottom liquidity fund bank of DGE, which is managed by DGE community.

We built DGE as the lowest feasible experimental digital cash, and when it was officially released, the price of DGE token was zero. After deployment, it depends entirely on the value of DGE's underlying assets to determine its market price and future governance direction. We will also use branches \(snapshots\) of the composite governance module to ensure that all updates to the DGEFI protocol are completed through community voting and are completely executed on the chain.

## Introduction to DGEFI

DGEFIAgreement is a decentralized financial agreement established on Ethereum. DGE As DGEFI Tokens generated by the agreement also serve as governance tokens for distributed green energy autonomous communities DAO Community voting management DGE Tokens. The purpose of its establishment is to establish a number of distributed green energy power stations, solar charging piles and other public environmental protection infrastructures worldwide to reduce global carbon emissions and benefit all mankind.

* Introduction to GBank

  GBank \(all called Green Energy digital encryption bank\) is a set of DEFI agreements established on Ethereum. Its main function is to link digital assets with entity assets, the combination of digital economy and real economy through blockchain technology makes the two complement each other and enables digital currency to have a real source of income, it also enables the heavy assets of the real economy to use digital cash to strengthen its liquidity through blockchain technology.

  The main function of GBank is to design various digital assets by professional financial talents, and use the technical methods of blockchain, that is, through DGEFI protocol, to cast cToken, that is cDGE, moreover, GBank takes cash assets and entity assets as the underlyiing assets for cDGE tokens, and generates the surplus of digital assets through the operation of a series of chain intelligent financial agreements. And invest all this surplus in the real distributed green energy industry, such as: distributed photovoltaic power station, distributed wind power station, distributed solar charging pile and other green energy industry. So as to solve the supply chain problem of energy construction funds in reality and strengthen the real source of income of digital cash.

* Asset pool

  GBank is a digital encrypted bank based on the underlying technology of blockchain and built by DGEFI distributed green digital energy protocol, aiming at achieving the goal of digital economy empowering the real economy. The entity asset data in the asset pool passes web3.js, which links the capacity data of real assets Self-developed LANCHAIN, so as to ensure that the governance of GBank in post-investment management is open and transparent, so that all holders of digital assets stored in GBank, truly feel the experience of participating in the protection of the Earth's environment. The following is the real-time capacity data analysis diagram of the physical photovoltaic power station called through web3.js: ![https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/H12365fd9856f45dfaae5936135ddb09c8.png!](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/H12365fd9856f45dfaae5936135ddb09c8.png!)

* Rewards pool

  The so-called rewards pool refers to the cash income generated by the entity assets invested by GBank, and this part of cash income will enter the smart agreement on the chain on a monthly basis, as the "mining" income of users who provide liquidity to DGE. With the continuous thickening of the real assets in sustainable operation, the more cash "ores" in the rewards pool are, which also encourages more users to participate and provides liquidity for DGE, the more digital assets are locked. Then the thicker the underlying digital assets of GBank, the higher the net value of DGE, and the better its liquidity will be.

* Machine gun Pool

  Machine gun pool is divided into Force machine gun pool and DeFi machine gun pool. Force machine gun pool refers The same type of "workload proof" mining as bitcoin mining, which has been called "traditional mining", is due toPrice and computing power often fluctuate up and down, and the profits of different projects with the same computing power digging the same type of algorithm sometimes differ greatly, therefore, there are minersCentralize the computing power into a mine pool, not specifying which currency to dig, but directly looking for several currencies in the same mining algorithm, and switching the computing power to which currency to dig for the highest profit, the final gain is the best. This method of constantly switching mining between different currencies is called "machine gun pool". In the DeFi era,Liquidity mining is very popular,The principle of the machine gun pool in DeFi is similar to that of the traditional machine gun pool. In fact, it is a strategic mining pool that achieves optimal benefits through intelligent scheduling.

  GBank's machine gun pool financial products are all designed by professional financial professionals, aiming at several DeFi varieties with the largest liquidity, the best stability and the highest profitability in the current market, such: compound/swUSD/USDT Vault/Dai Vault/yCRV Vault/renBTC, etc. Set the risk coefficient. The risk coefficient adopted by GBank combines three indicators: standard deviation,Β coefficient andSharpe index,This makes GBank's machine gun pool products reach a relative balance in terms of returns and risks, that is, on the premise of ensuring the risk-free returns of assets, the investment portfolio returns of assets are maximized. At present, the annualized rate of return in the test is basically stable between 30% and 45%, and the risk coefficient is between 0.5 and 1.\* DGE liquidity mining（DGE Liquidity mining --- Liquidity mining）

## DGE Liquidity mining --- Liquidity mining

* Product Design

  DGEFI generates initial governance token DGE through liquidity mining, so as to attract more users and funds to participate in this digital finance experiment. The initial token generated by liquidity mining is a fair, transparent and fair way and can helpDGEQuickly obtain initial users in a short time.DGEFIThe liquidity of mining will be divided into multiple stages, in order to gain high profits while having a stronger sense of reality and a sense of security, you can check the operation status of real assets under DGE token management at any time, and encourage more users to participate sustainably and obtain stable high returns. This is a simpler pledge mining business than Staking,One-click cash deposit and one-click cash withdrawal will increase profits..

  In order to ensure the intrinsic value of DGE tokens, DGE tokens do not pre-mine or reserve team tokens. And DGE tokens adopt the flexible supply mode, according to the market liquidity situation, flexible inflation or deflation of DGE tokens. The total number of DGE tokens publicly used in the liquidity pool for the first time is 1 million, and the initial net value of DGE is calculated based on RMB

  At the same time, DGE in the mine pool will use the net value of DGE in the liquidity pool as the standard of reference elastic supply. That is: NV\(DEG\)= S\(ETH\)/S\(DGE\)  
  \(NV refers to NetValue, that is, net value, unit is ETH/DGE, S refers to Supply, that is, the Supply of tokens\)

* Mining pool design

  The mine pool of DGE also adopts the elastic supply mechanism, that is, the supply of mine pool is proportional to the amount of lock-in of liquidity. That is to say, each flow input will generate 50% of the flow into ore and put it into the mine pool. However, the remaining amount of ore in the mine pool will remain unchanged for each reduction or zero increase of the flow. The purpose of this design is to ensure that DGE will not depreciate excessively.

  Mine Pool Supply S\(MiningPool\) = Σ\(SN\) \* 50%\)+ S\(0\)

  Σ\(SN\) Refers to the total amount of the forward purchase transaction DGE on that day, S\(0\)Refers to the remaining amount in the initial mining pool.

  Mining earnings = S\(invest\)/S\(liquidity\) \* S\(MiningPool\)

  The mining revenue of DGE mining pool is settled on a daily basis, which is affected by several important factors.

  F{S\(MiningPool\),S\(liquidity\),P\(DGE\)},P\(DGE\) is the price of the immediate DGE, then :

  Daily mining earnings = n / 365  _{S\(invest\)/S\(liquidity\)_  S\(MiningPool\)}；

  APY: F= S\(MiningPool\) / S\(liquidity\) \* P\(DGE\)；

  Initial mining pool is set to: 50000 DGE

* Design to ecological pool

  The ecological transaction pool will be gradually established. It is expected that transaction pairs will be set up in Uniswap DEX and Sushiswap DEX respectively. After that, transaction pairs such as HT and DAI will be activated one after another. And will gradually expand to ecological communities such as Defis and Polkadot.

* Advantages of DGE

  ~ Supported by underlying physical assets, the benefits are more real and stable.

  ~ Flexible supply system, no team reservation, no pre-mining. Follow the principle of more work and more gain to ensure the benefits of mining

  ~ Complete on-chain governance, permission to the community, open and transparent.

* Dual-engine mining

  Dual-engine mining is a 30-day liquidity product launched by GBank, which refers to the digital asset USDT that users provide DGE with 30-day liquidity in one direction and can obtain tokens of two kinds of digital assets at the same time, the tokens of this digital asset are DGE and USDT. DGE is the reward for users to participate in DGE30-day liquidity mining, and USDT is the monthly dividend of GBank’s real assets. Dual-engine mining products are launched every month, with a closed period of 30 days. The shares of each period are fixed, and the return on investment \(ROI\) is settled on a daily basis. USDT dividend calculation formula and DGE ore income calculation formula are as follows:

  Dividend income = amount of liquidity provided \(USDT\)/Total amount of open liquidity in the current period \(USDT\) _n/365_  dividend in the current period;

  For example, if a dividend of 20000 USDT is provided in the current dividend pool, the total liquidity opened in the current period is 135,000USDT, and the expected annual return rate is about 15%, A user provided 10,000 USDT liquidity on the first day. Then the bonus of USDT that it can obtain after the 30-day \(n\) period is:

  30-day USDT bonus for a user = 10000/135,000_30/365_20000 ≈ 123.46 USDT;

  Because DGE’s mine pool adopts the elastic supply mechanism, that is, the supply of mine pool is proportional to the amount of lock-in of liquidity. That is to say, each flow input will generate 50% of the flow into ore and put it into the mine pool. However, the remaining amount of ore in the mine pool will remain unchanged for each reduction or zero increase of the flow.

  Mine Pool Supply S\(MiningPool\) = Σ\(SN\) \* 50% + S\(0\);

  Σ\(SN\) Refers to the total number of DGE transactions generated on the current day.,S\(0\)Refers to the remaining amount in the initial mining pool\);

  Mining earnings = S\(invest\) / S\(liquidity\) \* S\(MiningPool\);

  Settlement by day = n / 365  _{S\(invest\) / S\(liquidity\)_  S\(MiningPool\)};

  Assume that a user provides one-way liquidity of US $10,000, the total amount of lock-up is US $5 million, and the remaining amount of ore in the mine pool is 1 million, and the daily settlement income, the user can get 5.4795DGE per day.

  At the same time, the user will also receive 123.46USDT, therefore, this mining mode is called “dual-engine” mining.

* Elastic supply mechanism

  The core mechanism of DGEFI is the price elasticity mechanism of DGE tokens, meaning It means that the total supply of DGE tokens is not fixed, but automatically adjusts the supply of tokens periodically. Smart protocol will be based on the net value of DGE NVDGEThe growth rate of, Rebase will be carried out every 12 hours, the flexible supply of tokens will be based on the market situation, in the adjustment, the proportion of the user’s currency will not change, will not be diluted. Rebases is carried out according to the growth range of specific DGE’s net value of tokens. The design idea is that the nominal net value of tokens will steadily increase with the passage of time, thus promoting the market price of DGE to rise. Every time the net value of DGE increases by more than 30%, Rebase will be triggered within 12 hours. Since the value of DGE is measured by CNY, the net value of DGE is also measured by CNY.

  For example, in the initial liquidity pool, there are 100W tokens in the DGE pool and 300 tokens in the ETH pool, then the net value of DGE at this time is: 1 NV≈ 0.000333 ETH, assuming 1 ETH = 3000 CNY, then 1 NV≈ 1 CNY, when the market price has been running for 12 hours, the net value of DGE becomes 1 NV≈ 1.3 CNY, that is to say, the net value of DGE increases by 30% within 12 hours, which triggers the Rebase mechanism. According to the initial circulation of 100W tokens in the DGE pool, this Rebase will generate 10% increment, that is, 100,000 DGE tokens, each coin-holding address will automatically receive 10% compensation for the amount of coins held.

  Similarly, when the net value of DGE decreases by 30% within 12 hours, the Rebase mechanism is also triggered, which will reduce the supply by 10%. For example, now the total amount of the DGE tokens is 110W in the pool, and the net value of DGE is from 1 NV= 1.3 CNY, and after 12 hours of market operation, its net value dropped to 1 NV= 0.91 CNY, then the rebase mechanism is triggered also, that is, the total market supply is reduced by 10%. That is to say, from total supply of 110W DGE tokens dropped to 990,000 DGE tokens. This is, due to the decrease of supply, its intrinsic value has increased.

  The formula of flexible supply inflation: \(1+10%\)^n \* Total remaining amount of initial tokens;

  \(n refers to the number of Rebase inflation\).

  Flexible supply deflation formula: \(1-10%\)^n \* Total remaining amount of initial tokens;

  \(n refers to the number of times Rebase is removed\).

  Flexible tokens will automatically adjust the market supply of DGE according to the change of the underlying number of DGE tokens to ensure that the intrinsic value of DGE tokens will not collapse. Moreover, with the passage of time, the internal value of the distributed entity assets managed by DGE will increase steadily, which makes the market price of DGE also rise.

  To sum up, the elastic supply system of DGE determines the market supply of DGE according to the change of its intrinsic value rather than its market price. This kind of design pays more attention to the intrinsic value of DGE tokens than just the market price of DGE. Because DGE itself is not valuable, the significance of DGE’s generation and circulation lies in its better service to the global green energy entity industry through this mechanism.

  Therefore, DGE is like a kind of fund product of global new energy industry, which has its underlying assets and capitals, and through a series of operations, it increases the underlying assets and capitals, so as to make DGE’s net value rise steadily, at the same time, it will also make its market price rise continuously.

## underlying reserve assets
* Overview
  
   DGEFI protocol is a group of decentralized intelligent financial protocols. Its underlying assets are composed of high-activity digital financial products and can be cashed at any time. The underlying asset library of DGEFI protocol is completely controlled by the DGE token holder and can provide various governance functions to enable the DGE token holder to obtain higher benefits.
   
   Because the underlying asset bank has the function of high realizable, in fact, it is also used as the reserve for GBank, so it can provide a reference for the intrinsic value of DGE. Just like fund products, with the appreciation of the digital wealth management products invested by the fund, the value of the underlying assets also increases. It can also be used to generate additional benefits for the agreement, therefore, the underlying asset library can still maintain the stability of its internal value after the base change mechanism. The DGEFI protocol initially specifies the stable currency DAI with higher returns as the initial reserve asset of the underlying asset library. After that, as the market changes and the community discusses and decides which digital agreement asset to use as the underlying reserve asset of DGE.

* Other cases
  
  In addition to the intrinsic value effect and DAI revenue, the underlying reserve assets can also be managed and deployed in various other ways that the holder of the DGE token considers appropriate. This may include diversifying assets in other encrypted currencies, providing funds for early agreements, paying organizational costs, and increasing liquidity in the new DGEFI financial agreement.

## Governance

* Overview

  DGEFI is a decentralized financial agreement dedicated to the governance of distributed green energy entity assets. The control of this agreement will be handed over to the global green energy autonomy \(DAO\) organization, namely the DGE token holder, which means that the update of the agreement and fund management can only be carried out with the approval of the DGE holder.

  Governance methods The governance process is through the website governance interface \( Initiate suggestions \) button to link to a third-party forum \(Snapshot\) First, submit a proposal for discussion. If the community expresses interest in the proposal and discusses and modifies the proposal, the proposal will be submitted \(Snapshot\) . The Out-of-chain governance, where DGE token holders can use their balance of tokens to vote.

  If your proposal passed on the \(Snapshot\), then no code needs to be executed, that is, the approved operation can be taken.

  If you need to deploy the code, the code will be reviewed when necessary, and then suggestions will be made through on-chain governance. At that time, the token holder will vote again to deploy the code.

* Time limit

  Forum discussion: 1-3 days

  Outside-chain \(Snapshot\) voting: 3 days

  Online voting: 2 days

  Execution time locked: 12 hours

* About proposal initiation, deployment and execution

  Initiator of the proposal: the holder must have 50,000 DGE tokens before he can go to a third-party forum \(Snapshot\) On;

  Proposal deployment: only authorized by Master-control-contract that addresses can be deployed;

  Implementation of the proposal: for security reasons, only the owner of Master-control-contract has the right to enable execution.

* About entrustment

  The composite governance module requires users to join the governance. In order to qualify their tokens for on-chain voting, DGE token holders can vote by themselves or entrust the other party to initiate a proposal or vote on the proposal. You can use the authorization interface of dgefi.finance to perform operations. If you are familiar with the code, you can also use etherscan to perform authorization.

* Legal votes

  The legal number of votes for proposals and executions on the chain is based on the proportion of valid votes that are eligible for voting and participate in voting to the total number of votes, the number of tokens that have voted is not affected by the number of inflated votes generated during this period or the number of votes reduced due to deflation.

  To submit a new proposal, the user must entrust 50,000 DGE tokens to the governance.sol protocol. During the proposal period, the governance protocol will lock these proposal tokens for three days. Sponsors themselves cannot vote for their own proposals.

  In order for the proposal to pass and be deployed and executed on the chain, it must be that the number of votes in favor is greater than the number of votes against.
