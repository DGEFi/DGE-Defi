# Introduction to DGEFI
DGEFIProtocol is a distributed digital energy governance token protocol which established on Ethereum. DGE As DGEFI Tokens generated by the agreement, which are used as governance tokens for distributed green energy autonomous communities, are composed of green energy DAO Community voting management DGE Tokens aim to establish a number of distributed green energy power stations, solar charging piles and other public environmental protection infrastructures worldwide to reduce global carbon emissions and benefit all mankind.
* Introduction to GBank

    GBank (all called Green Energy digital encryption bank) is a DEFI agreement established on Ethereum. Its main function is to link digital assets with entity assets, the combination of digital economy and real economy through blockchain technology makes the two complement each other and enables digital currency to have a real source of income, it also enables the heavy assets of the real economy to use digital cash to strengthen its liquidity through blockchain technology.
    
    The main function of GBank is to cast various digital assets into DGE tokens through the design of professional financial talents and the technical means of blockchain, that is, through DGEFI protocol, moreover, GBank will invest cash assets and real assets as the support of DGE tokens, and generate the surplus of digital assets through the operation of a series of chain intelligent financial agreements. And invest all this surplus in the real distributed green energy industry, such as: distributed photovoltaic power station, distributed wind power station, distributed solar charging pile and other green energy industry. So as to solve the supply chain problem of energy construction funds in reality and strengthen the real source of income of digital cash.
* Asset pool
GBank is a digital encrypted bank based on the underlying technology of blockchain and built by DGEFI distributed green digital energy protocol, aiming at achieving the goal of digital economy empowering the real economy. The entity asset data in the asset pool passes web3.js, which links the capacity data of real assets Self-developed LANCHAIN, so as to ensure that the governance of GBank in post-investment management is open and transparent, so that all holders of digital assets stored in GBank, truly feel the experience of participating in the protection of the Earth's environment.
The following is the real-time capacity data analysis diagram of the physical photovoltaic power station called through web3.js:

* Rewards pool
The so-called rewards pool refers to the cash income generated by the entity assets invested by GBank, and this part of cash income will enter the smart agreement on the chain on a monthly basis, as the "mining" income of users who provide liquidity to DGE.
With the continuous thickening of the real assets in sustainable operation, the more cash "ores" in the rewards pool are, which also encourages more users to participate and provides liquidity for DGE, the more digital assets are locked. Then the thicker the underlying digital assets of GBank, the higher the net value of DGE, and the better its liquidity will be.
